        particular ways of serving as well. This is known as Bangaliketa (Bengali: বাঙালি কেতা). The culture also
        defines the way to invite people to weddings and for dinner. Gifts are given on certain occasions. Bangaliketa
        also includes a way of serving utensils in a proper manner.Traditional food in Bangladesh reflects the country’s
        culinary past and its rich heritage influenced by the many empires and cultures that inhabited its land.Unlike
        other countries where modern takes of food are prevalent, almost all the food in Bangladesh is still
        traditional. Despite every household having its own recipes for the famous Bangladeshi recipes, the foundations

    <p><i> Bangladeshi cuisine has over time been largely influenced by the Mughlai cuisine left behind by the Persian
        Rulers. This has led Bangladeshi cuisine to include many rich aromatic dishes such as biriyani and korma that
        requires the use of a large array of spices along with an extensive amount of ghee. Dhaka being the Mughal
        Capital of the Bengal Subah (Which Includes the modern Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal) was a
        major trading center in South Asia, so many culinary styles from around the world influenced the city's cuisine.
        After Dhaka became the capital of East Bengal, Bangladesh the populace began to adopt the cuisine of the city
        with many unknown Persian, Turkish and Arabic influenced dishes becoming hugely popular.

        <p><i> BANGLADESH offers a rich variety of delicacies for every palate. The sweet tooth of Bengalis, as well as
            the variety of sweets and desserts available in the region, is astounding. While some of those
            quintessentially Bengali recipes and items have now found their way to the rest of the country, there are
            several Bengali sweets which have not reached their deserved potential and popularity yet.One of the most
            famous Bengali sweets, Roshogolla is a soft round mithai made out of Chhena and dipped into a sugary syrup.
            Rajbhog is a close cousin of this famed sweet, with a delicious stuffing in its centre that can be made of
            dry fruits, saffron, cardamom and so on. With this dessert, it is usually difficult to stop after devouring
            only one.</p>
