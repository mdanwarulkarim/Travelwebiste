    <p>Packing is pivotal. Forget an essential item and you're left disappointed and scrambling to find the nearest
      store in your destination. Pack too much and you end up disorganized, burdened with heavy bags, and hemorrhaging
      money to pay for pricey airline baggage fees. So we thought it best to revisit the most basic—and most
      useful—packing rules. Here are 6 fundamental packing strategies that every traveler should learn.</p>

      <h4>Make A Packing List</h4>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>When it comes to packing, procrastinators fall short. Start your packing process days or even weeks ahead of
        your departure date; this gives you time to craft a complete list, plus purchase any additional items you might
        need for your vacation. Creating a packing list is a fail-safe way to ensure that you never, ever forget to
        bring something important.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Roll Don't Fold</h4>
      <img src="images/Roll.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Many travel experts including backpackers, who must stuff months' worth of clothing into a pack the size of a
        box of wine agree that rolling is superior to folding. Tightly rolled clothes take up less space than folded
        ones. Plus, they're less prone to getting deep wrinkles from fold creases.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Never Check Essential Items </h4>
      <img src="images/carry.jpg" alt="">
      <p>It's terribly important to keep your valuable and essential belongings in your carry-on bag, not in your
        checked luggage. Your passport, identification, money, credit cards, jewelry, electronics, and other valuables
        should always be brought onto the plane with you. We probably don't need to tell you why you need to keep your
        passport and wallet on your person. But if the airline loses your luggage (or if a TSA agent gets sticky
        fingers), you'll regret stowing your expensive watch in a checked bag.</p>

      <h4>Know Your Airline's Baggage-fee Policy</h4>
      <img src="images/know your.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Figuring out the airlines' tricky and befuddling baggage-fee policies is key to any budget-minded packing
        strategy. While most airlines permit travelers to check at least one bag on international flights, the majority
        of U.S. carriers charge big bucks for bags checked on domestic flights. Spirit Airlines—that notoriously
        customer-unfriendly discounter—even charges as much as $100 for carry-on bags.</p>
      <br>
      <h4> Follow The 3-1-1 Rule</h4>
      <img src="images/Three.jpg" alt="">
      <p>What happens if you don't follow the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) 3-1-1 rule for carry-on
        luggage? Attempt to bring a large bottle of shampoo or a full-size gel deodorant through the security line and
        the TSA will likely confiscate your stuff, holding you up in line in the process. So get familiar with the
        agency's rules: All liquids brought onto planes must be in 3.4-ounce bottles or smaller and inside a single,
        clear, quart-size zip-top bag</p>
      <br>
      <h4> Use Your Personal Items Wisely</h4>
      <img src="images/uses.jpg" alt="">
      <p>It's standard for airlines to permit each traveler to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item onboard
        planes. This personal item is subject to specific size requirements (these vary by airline), but something like
        a purse, laptop bag, or backpack is generally acceptable.</p>
